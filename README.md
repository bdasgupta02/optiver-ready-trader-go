Two of my strategies for Optiver's Ready Trader Go competition. One uses a rolling regression/hedge ratio method, while the other one is a simpler market maker that uses dynamic spread and rebalancing mechanisms. Both are averse to hedging - and hedge as late as possible. The simple market maker tends to do better in testing.
