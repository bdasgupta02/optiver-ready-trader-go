Two of my strategies for Optiver's Ready Trader Go competition. One uses a rolling regression/hedge ratio method, while the other one is a simpler market maker that uses dynamic spread and rebalancing mechanisms. Both are averse to hedging - and hedge as late as possible. The simple market maker tends to do better in testing.

The simpler market maker was submitted for the tournament and came in within the top 64 traders out of 1k+. Latency was identified as a big issue for the market maker, as it started losing out to faster traders later into the tournament.
